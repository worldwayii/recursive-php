## To get the project running, firstly you will need to create a database with name 'netpay' then, supply the database config (name and password) on for you local config on config.php.
## Some migration needs to be done, run the query in dbTable.sql to create table needed.
## Change directory and when inside the root start up a quick server to spin up the application with: php -S localhost:9000 (PS: port 9000 can be whichever desired).
## Visit localhost:9000 and the files get written to the database from file.txt
## Visit the /search route and search files


Thank you
